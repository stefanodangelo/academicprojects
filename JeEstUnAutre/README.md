Software developed for the exhibition *Je Est Un Autre* by [Chiara Bozzato](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiara-bozzato-45044417a/). \
It consists in a projection of a video taken from one of the following inputs:
- PC webcam
- external (USB) webcam
- IP webcam

The video is recorded for a certain amount of seconds, and then it is projected at a slower speed. \
Seconds, speed, and type of input are modifiable parameters, that can be found at the beginning of the script `jeEstUnAutre.py`.

The exhibition took place on November 19th, 2021 in Milan at Associazione Circuiti Dinamici.
