# academicprojects
All the projects in this folder are divided by subject and are shareable, with a few exceptions.
## Algorithms and Data Structures
C program inspired by a social network in which users can enstablish one-sided relationships with other users and, through a specific command. The main function of the program is called by a specific command and it can show, for each relationship existing in this network, all the people receiving the maximum number of relationships of that kind.
## Digital Logic Design
Programmed an FPGA in VHDL that simulates the Working Zone encoding system for a group of addresses with 8 bits.
## Software Engineering 1
Online version of the board game Santorini leveraging a Model-View-Controller architecture written in Java. The project was heavily focused on both programming aspects, including the usage of Object-Oriented Programming and Design Patterns, and modeling aspects (UML).
## Recommender Systems | Kaggle Competition
Implementation in Python of a system for books recommendation.
## Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning | Kaggle Competition
Implementation in Python of a neural network for the classification of images.
## CodaLab, 1st ACRE Cascade Competition | Kaggle Competition
Implementation in Python of a neural network for the segmentation of images.
## Software Engineering 2
Analysis of Â© Zapata Computing Orquestra platform, a quantum computing engine for orchestrating quantum workflows.
## Data Science
Convolutional Neural Network for the classification of [Pl@ntNet Dataset](https://plantnet.org/en/).
## Statistical Computational Methods
Classification of gesture data on one over 15 different dataset, and analysis of the influence of the other datasets on model's performance.
## Computer Vision
Final Degree Project on **Neural Style Transfer with Image Segmentation**. The goal was to transfer the artistic style of Van Gogh from his paintings to real photos in order to augment the dataset containing his paintings. The work done introduced some novelty to the state-of-the-art and it is publicly available at [this](https://github.com/stefanodangelo/vangogh) repository, which is the main repository for the paper [Revisiting Artistic Style Transfer for Data Augmentation in A Real-Case Scenario](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9897728).
## Je Est Un Autre
Personal projects developed for an exhibition curated by Visual Arts student of the IUAV University in Venice, Italy. The exhibition took place at Circuiti Dinamici in Milan (Italy) and consists of a camera installment that captures videos of people in a room and, after a few seconds, replays the video both in fast and slow motion to give the spectator the feeling of not recognizing themselves in their recorded character.

# Not sharable projects
Some projects are not shareable due to NDAs between me, my university and the involved company.
These are:
- Digital Business Innovation (company: **Sony Music Italy**): ideation of a digital solution to increase revenues through voice activation using smart devices (e.g. Alexa)
- Strategy and Marketing (company: **Chateau d'Ax**): definition of a repositioning strategy in Italy
