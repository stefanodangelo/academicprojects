All the projects in this folder are divided by subject
## Algorithms and Data Structures
C program inspired by a social network in which users can enstablish one-sided relationships with other users and, through a specific command. The main function of the program is called by a specific command and it can show, for each relationship existing in this network, all the people receiving the maximum number of relationships of that kind.
## Digital Logic Design
VHDL program that simulates the Working Zone encoding system for a restricted group of addresses, that is those ones with 8 bits.
## Software Engineering 1
Online mode adaptation, completely written in Java, of an already existing board game called Santorini.
## Recommender Systems
Implementation in Python of a recommender systems for books.
## Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning 
### Kaggle competition
Implementation in Python of a neural network for the classification of images.
### CodaLab, 1st ACRE Cascade Competition
Implementation in Python of a neural network for the segmentation of images.
## Strategy & Marketing
Definition of a strategy for the repositioning of the brand Chateau d’Ax in Italy.
## Software Engineering 2
Research project on the study of Orquestra’s features, a platform for the execution of quantum algorithms. Two algorithms
have been treated: Grover’s algorithm, adapted to Orquestra, and Linear Regression, formulated as a QUBO
problem and run on D-Wave.
## Designing Digital Business Innovation Lab
Digital Innovation project developed for Sony Music Italy consisting in the definition of a strategy, exploiting voice
activation and AI algorithms, to increase Sony’s market share.
