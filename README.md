# academicprojects
All the projects in this folder are divided by subject
## Algorithms and Data Structures
C program inspired by a social network in which users can enstablish one-sided relationships with other users and, through a specific command. The main function of the program is called by a specific command and it can show, for each relationship existing in this network, all the people receiving the maximum number of relationships of that kind.
## Digital Logic Design
VHDL program that simulates the Working Zone encoding system for a restricted group of addresses, that is those ones with 8 bits.
## Software Engineering 1
Online mode adaptation, completely written in Java, of an already existing board game called Santorini.
## Recommender Systems
#### Kaggle Competition
Implementation in Python of a recommender systems for books.
## Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning 
#### Kaggle competition
Implementation in Python of a neural network for the classification of images.
#### CodaLab, 1st ACRE Cascade Competition
Implementation in Python of a neural network for the segmentation of images.
## Software Engineering 2
Analysis of Â© Zapata Computing Orquestra platform, a quantum computing engine.
## Data Science
Convolutional Neural Network for the classification of [Pl@ntNet Dataset](https://plantnet.org/en/).
## Statistical Computational Methods
Classification of gesture data on one over 15 different dataset, and analysis of the influence of the other datasets on model's performance.
## \_personal
Personal projects developed outside the university context.
## Computer Vision
Final Degree Project on **Neural Style Transfer with Image Segmentation**. The goal was to transfer the artistic style of Van Gogh from his paintings to real photos in order to augment the dataset containing his paintings. The work done introduced some novelty to the state-of-the-art and it is publicly available at [this](https://github.com/stefanodangelo/vangogh) repository. 

# Not sharable projects
Some projects are not shareable due to NDAs between me, my university and the involved company.
These are:
- Digital Business Innovation (company: **Sony Music Italy**): development of a digital solution to increase revenues through voice activation
- Strategy and Marketing (company: **Chateau d'Ax**): definition of a repositioning strategy in Italy
