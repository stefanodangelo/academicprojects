All the projects in this folder are divided by subject
## Algorithms and Data Structures
C program inspired by a social network in which users can enstablish one-sided relationships with other users and, through a specific command. The main function of the program is called by a specific command and it can show, for each relationship existing in this network, all the people receiving the maximum number of relationships of that kind.
## Digital Logic Design
VHDL program that simulates the Working Zone encoding system for a restricted group of addresses, that is those ones with 8 bits.
## Software Engineering 1
Online mode adaptation, completely written in Java, of an already existing board game called Santorini.
## Recommender Systems
Implementation in Python of a recommender systems for books.
## Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning 
#### Kaggle competition
Implementation in Python of a neural network for the classification of images.
#### CodaLab, 1st ACRE Cascade Competition
Implementation in Python of a neural network for the segmentation of images.

# Not sharable projects
Some projects are not shareable due to NDAs between me, my university and the involved company.
These are:
- Software Engineering 2 (company: **Zapata Computing**): research project on the study of Orquestraâ€™s features, a platform for the execution of quantum algorithms
- Digital Business Innovation (company: **Sony Music Italy**): development of a digital solution to increase revenues through voice activation
- Strategy and Marketing (company: **Chateau d'Ax**): definition of a repositioning strategy in Italy

# Coming soon
Final Degree Project on **Neural Style Transfer with Image Segmentation**.
