## Project description

This project aims at assessing the capabilities of [Orquestra](https://www.zapatacomputing.com/orquestra/) and [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), both workflow management platforms, in the quantum computing domain.
Two different algorithms adopting two different quantum computing paradigms, the gate model and the adiabatic computing model, have been implemented as workflows on both platforms.

In this repository we make available a report regarding different aspects of the project.

Besides the material available in this repository, the project is also made of:

### Colab notebooks

Notebooks with experimental results on the algorithms, including:

- [Quantum linear regression](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fxZ4Izw-3z7z5SrGrYtkswt5v8-fRnzC?usp=sharing)

- [Grover](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14tbPA2-KiiqxMMzDDEYzknvCkT2LMXMy?usp=sharing)


### Orquestra repositories

Repositories with components and steps retrieved by Orquestra at run-time, including:

- [Quantum linear regression](https://github.com/Alexdruso/linear-regression-orquestra)

- [Grover](https://github.com/stefanodangelo/grover-orquestra)
